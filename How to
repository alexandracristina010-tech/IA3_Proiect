How to Reproduce

Train the baseline classifier
Run TextFooler and HotFlip attacks
Evaluate performance
Generate adversarial examples for training
Retrain the model using combined clean + adversarial data
Re-evaluate using both attacks
Apply Feature Squeezing alone or combined with adversarial training

Each step is included in the project notebooks.
